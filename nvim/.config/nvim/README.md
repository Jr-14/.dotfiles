# Installing Neovim

The preferred installation method is via a tar.gz file which will give you a directory with a binary.

You can then move the new neovim directory to `~/Apps`

Once it's been moved to the `~/Apps` directory, we can then symlink it into `~/.local/bin`;

Check it's been installed correctly by checking `nvim --version`
